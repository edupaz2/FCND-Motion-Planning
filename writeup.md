# Required Steps for a Passing Submission:
1. Load the 2.5D map in the colliders.csv file describing the environment.
2. Discretize the environment into a grid or graph representation.
3. Define the start and goal locations.
4. Perform a search using A* or other search algorithm.
5. Use a collinearity test or ray tracing method (like Bresenham) to remove unnecessary waypoints.
6. Return waypoints in local ECEF coordinates (format for `self.all_waypoints` is [N, E, altitude, heading], where the droneâ€™s start location corresponds to [0, 0, 0, 0].
7. Write it up.
8. Congratulations!  Your Done!

## [Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/1534/view) Points
### Here I will consider the rubric points individually and describe how I addressed each point in my implementation.  

---
### Writeup / README

#### 1. Provide a Writeup / README that includes all the rubric points and how you addressed each one.  You can submit your writeup as markdown or pdf.

You're reading it! Below I describe how I addressed each rubric point and where in my code each point is handled.

### Explain the Starter Code

#### 1. Explain the functionality of what's provided in `motion_planning.py` and `planning_utils.py`
These scripts contain a basic planning implementation that includes a class inheriting from udacidrone.Drone super class.

The main point about this class is that it is based on Event Driven Programming, a programming paradigm in which the flow of execution is determined by external events rather than a pre-defined sequence of steps. For doing so, it registers a few callbacks inside `__init__` function:
- local_position_callback: event fired when the local position of the Drone has changed.
- velocity_callback: event fired when the velocity of the Drone has changed.
- state_callback: event fired when the state of the Drone has changed.

With the help of the states and the transitions between them, we will control the Drone:
1. MANUAL. Manual state, no planner is being involved in here.
2. ARMING. The Drone is armed and ready.
3. TAKEOFF. The Drone is taking off the ground to reach the desired height.
4. WAYPOINT. Once at the desired height, the Drone will follow the waypoints we command. This is actually where the real planning is going on.
5. LANDING. Arrival at the final destination and ready to land.
6. DISARMING. Drone has landed and disarms.

Here is a visual of the waypoints planned at the `motion_planning.py` ![Grid Path](./misc/motion_planning.1.png)

### Implementing Your Path Planning Algorithm

### 0. Preflight step: precompute a flying node graph
We precompute a flying node graph, from the grid data, for later used when finding a path.

#### Medial Axis grid: [notebook](./research_medial_axis_grid.ipynb)
- Medial Axis with 848241 nodes, shape (921, 921)
- Medial Axis took 0.5097260475158691 seconds to build

#### Random Sampling: [notebook](./research_random_sampling.ipynb)
- Grid dimensions:  (921, 921)
- Original nodes 2013
- Graph nodes:  1972
- Graph edges:  8683

#### Voronoi graph: [notebook](./research_voronoi.ipynb)
- Grid dimensions:  (921, 921)
- Original nodes:  5858
- Graph nodes:  3243
- Graph edges:  7277

#### 1. Set your global home position
We read the global home location from the first line of the colliders.csv file and set that position as global home (self.set_home_position()) in [source](./motion_planning.py#L205)

#### 2. Set your current local position
We determine the drone local position relative to global home calling the function ```global_to_local``` in [source](./motion_planning.py#L210)

#### 3. Set grid start position from local position
Another step for adding flexibility to the start location at [source](./motion_planning.py#L232)

#### 4. Set grid goal position from geodetic coords
This step is to add flexibility to the desired goal location. Should be able to choose any (lat, lon) within the map and have it rendered to a goal location on the grid.

#### 5. Modify A* to include diagonal motion (or replace A* altogether)
Minimal requirement here is to modify the code in planning_utils() to update the A* implementation to include diagonal motions on the grid that have a cost of sqrt(2), but more creative solutions are welcome. Explain the code you used to accomplish this step.

#### 6. Cull waypoints 
For this step you can use a collinearity test or ray tracing method like Bresenham. The idea is simply to prune your path of unnecessary waypoints. Explain the code you used to accomplish this step.



### Execute the flight
#### 1. Does it work?
It works!

### Double check that you've met specifications for each of the [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/1534/view) points.
  
# Extra Challenges: Real World Planning

For an extra challenge, consider implementing some of the techniques described in the "Real World Planning" lesson. You could try implementing a vehicle model to take dynamic constraints into account, or implement a replanning method to invoke if you get off course or encounter unexpected obstacles.
